# Shopping-list
A simple web app that lets users add and delete items from a shopping list. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates DOM manipulation, event handling, and input validation. Each item added creates a new list entry with a delete button, allowing real-time updates to the list.
